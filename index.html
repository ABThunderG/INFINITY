	There are a lot of questions which remain unanswered sometimes. These questions generate the eager in us to know more about them, and possibly find their answers.<BR>
	One of these questions being - Is Infinity possible? Well, seems like that is what we are going to discuss today.....<BR><BR>
	<B><I>[NOTE: THIS IS A SIMPLE EXPLANATION, WHICH MIGHT AS WELL BE WRONG]</B></I><BR><BR>
	To a lot of people Infinity is a very interesting topic, why not! Some argue that it is nonsense, while some say that it can be made possible, as humans advance in technology..<BR>
	The simple answer to such a question is - 'NO'.
	Infinity is simply impossible. And this is possibly the simplest way of demonstrating that...
	We all know about Mathematics, right? The good old Maths which most people somewhat fear from.
	Numbers are infinite, while their constituting digits are finite. Now remember this, this is going to be very important in the subsequent discussion.
	Lets take a very simple example:
	On dividing 1 by 10 we get 0.1, 1 by 100 we get 0.01, 1 by 1000 we get 0.001, and so on....
	On dividing 1 by 1000...(infinite zeros), we get 0.0000..(infinite zeros)1.
	But here's the problem, if we have infinite zeros before 1, we cannot mark any end to the zeros so as to place the last digit in the quotiont i.e. 1.<BR>
	So, ultimately we would need an unlimited source of raw materials and an unlimited time frame within which we have to pursue the creation of that infinity possessing object.
 	Hence, we are stuck...<BR><BR>
	Now, I don't think this has any relation to what Infinity actually is..
	You might find numerous other websites which might stress on the same topic but in a much more complex procedure. And I do agree to such relations.
	But my aim is just to satisfy the need for an answer to such a question.
	I know this example might not have any relation to Infinity.<BR>
	But, as I told you before - "Numbers are infinite, while their constituting digits are finite", so what if we can create or find a raw material, which we can combine together to create multiple products, which we can use to produce the desired infinite object!
	But, again, there's a problem, an infinite object does not have any end point, so we cannot stop the process. In fact according to science, matter can neither be created nor be destroyed.<BR><BR>
	Hence, if we consider something to be infinite we simpy mean that, that object is present in an enormous quantity or quality. If you want to make more of it, go ahead, but otherwise, just forget it...<BR><BR>
	And with that I end this discussion, and hope that the readers are satisfied.<BR>
	SO IS INFINITY POSSIBLE? WELL, NOT REALLY....
